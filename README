These are files that can be used to check your PHP code using PHP
CodeSniffer.  Code will be checked for coding standards, formatting,
PHPDoc blocks, silly mistakes and more.

Developed under phpcs version 1.3.3.

Installation
------------

Clone this repo in a directory named "Snap" under the "Standards" folder of
your phpcs installation.

Editor integration
------------------

VIM

Add to your .vimrc:

function! RunPhpcs()
	let l:filename=@%
	let l:phpcs_output=system('phpcs --report=csv '.l:filename)
	let l:phpcs_list=split(l:phpcs_output, "\n")
	unlet l:phpcs_list[0]
	cexpr l:phpcs_list
	cwindow
endfunction
set errorformat+=\"%f\"\\,%l\\,%c\\,%t%*[a-zA-Z]\\,\"%m\"\\,%*[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]\\,%*[0-9]
command! Phpcs execute RunPhpcs()
nmap <Leader>sn :call RunPhpcs()<cr>

This will allow you to run phpcs with the results in a Quickfix list by
entering the command :Phpcs or \sn (mnemonic: sniff).

Alternatively you can try the Vim Syntastic plugin which will use phpcs
automatically if it's in your PATH.
